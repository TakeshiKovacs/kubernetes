#### Log into the argocd ui and add the repo 
https://github.com/TakeshiKovacs/git-ops

#### Check repos and cleanup if necessary
https://github.com/TakeshiKovacs/git-ops/tree/main/kubernetes
This should only have the template folder

#### Now go to our repo application repo in git hub
https://github.com/TakeshiKovacs/argo-sample-app
Manually trigger the workflow

#### Port forwarding to see the app
kubectl port-forward svc/my-app 8080:80 -n my-app

#### Make a small change to the app and push it to the repo
Update the index.html file in the argo-sample-app repo

#### Once the action has run, refresh the app to see it is now out of sync, then sync it

#### We are now happy that argo works, lets have it auto sync
In the app, in details, enable auto-sync

#### Now we are going to make another change to the app
Update the index.html file in the argo-sample-app repo again

#### Wait a min or so to see the app update itself. if it doesn't then refresh and watch it auto deploy
Once deployed redo port forwarding to see the new version of the app
kubectl port-forward svc/my-app 8080:80 -n my-app

#### Oops, we made a mistake, lets rollback
Go to the application and then History and Rollback, select the previous version and select rollback

#### Note the application status is now OutOfSync
Also note that we had to disable auto sync for rollback, this means we have to manually sync it and then re-enable auto sync once we are happy
